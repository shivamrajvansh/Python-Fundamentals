-> Python :- It is a high-level , general-purpose, interpreted programming language.
   -> High-Level :- It makes it easy to learn.Python doesn't require us to understand the details of the computer in order to develop programs. 
   -> General-purpose :- We can use python in many domains 
     -> Web applications , Big data applications , testing , automations , DS | Ml | Al , Mobile Apps , Desktop softwares etc.
  -> Interpriting :- scripting langauge execute line by line.

  -> Why Python 
     -> Open sourse 
     -> Cross Platform 
     -> It increases our productivity.It allows us to solve complex problems in less time and fewer lines of code.
     -> Heavy computating work 
     -> Large ecosystem 
  -> Python Version 
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
    -> Environmental Setup 
      https://www.python.org/downloads/ (download and install)
        -> open cmd 
          python --version 
    -> Setup Visual Studio Code for python 
    https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
      -> install python extension 
    --> extension is .py 

    --> IDE :- Jupitor notebook 
    https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb
      --> Python Syntax 
         Whitespace and indentation 
          def main():
            i=1 
            max=10;
            while (i<max):
              print(i)
              i=i+1 
          main()
    -> comments 
     # is used for comments 

     -> Python Variables 
        -> Variables are the temporary memory location which hold input data.
        It is a label that we can assign a value to it.
          syntex:
          variable_name=value 
          -> Naming Convension 
            -> It contain only letters , numbers and underscores(_). Start with a letter or in underscore(_), not with a number 
            -> Variable names cannot the same as keywords, reserver-keywords and some predefined methods.
            eg: 
            empName="anuj";
            emp_salary=12345;
          -> String :- It is a series of character. Anything inside a quote is a string 
           ' ' 
           " "
           '''  '''
           -> 
greeting='Good'
time='Afternoon'
completeString=greeting + time + '!'
print(completeString)
print(completeString[0])#G 
print(completeString[1])#o
print(len(completeString))#14
print(completeString[0:4])#Good

--> Python strings are immutable 
    completeString[0]="S" # not possible 
--> Numbers (Integers and Floats)
    age=23
    percentage=89.45
--> Boolean (true | false)
  is_active=True 
  is_admin=False 
--> Constants :- readonly value 
   No build-in features to define 

   --> Python Datatypes 
     In python the datatypes are allocate at runtime 
       -> Build in Datatype 
          -> Numeric (Interger , Float, complex number)
          -> Sequence Type (Strings , List , Tuple )
          -> Boolean 
          -> Set 
          -> Dictionary 
        --> Numeric :- numeric value (interger , float , even complex number)
             -> Integers :- positive or negative whole number.(no limit to define a integer value)
             -> Float :- decimal value 
             -> Complex Number :- (real part)+(imaginary part) 2+3j
            ** to check the datatype at runtime we have type()
        -> Sequence Type (is the ordered collection of similar or different data types)
            -> String : collection of 1 or more characters 
               str="Hello John!";
               print(type(str))
            -> List :- are just liek the arrays.
              myList=[];
              myList=["sumit"]
              myList=["sumit","amit","anil"]
              myList[0]
              myList[2]
            -> Tuple :- Just like list. Difference is that tuples are immutable.It cant be modified after it is created.
           myTuple=('Amit','ANil')
           print(myTuple)
           print(myTuple[0])
           myTuple[0]="Sunil"//not possible 
           print(myTuple)
           -> Dictionary :- are kind of hash table type.It consists of key-value pairs .The key can be almost any type , but are usaually numbers or strings . 
             They are enclosed by curly braces {} and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces[]
               eg:
                 dict={}
                 dict['one']="first data"
                 dict[2]="second data";
                 mydict={'name':'anuj','age':23,'dept':'it'}
          -> In Dictionary we can add , modifiy the values as per the requirement
          mydict['city']="noida"
         -> for delete 
           del dicy[key]
          -> Type conversion :- 
            int() 
            long() 
            float()
            complex() 
            str()
            eval()
            tuple()
            list()
            set()
            dict()
            chr()
          -> To input a data we have :- input() :- It accept values in the form of string
          -> \n is used for new line 

        -> Operators :- to perform operations 
            -> Arthematic :- + , - , / ,* ,% ,++ , --
            -> Assignment :- = , += , -= , /= 
            -> Relational :- > , < , >= , <= 
            -> Comparison :- == , != 
            -> Logical :- and , or , not 
            -> Bitwise 
            -> Membership Operators 
              in 
              not in 
            -> Identity Operators 
              is 
              is not 
            -> Selection | Control Flow (return boolean )
             if else :- 
                -> if statement 
                   if condition:
                     if-block 
            -> if else 
              if condition:
                  if-block 
              else :
                  else-block
            -> if else if else 
              if conditon :
                 ---
              elif conditon
                  ---
              elif condition
                  ---
              else :
                  ---
          -> Assignments 
          1. Wap to input 2 values in 2 variables and swap them.
             -> with the help of 3rd variable 
             -> without help of 3rd variable 
             -> in one line or expression 
          2. Wap to input 3 digit number , reverse it and also find the sum of a digit of a number ?
            Hint :-
              num=123
              rev=321
              sum=6
          3. Wap to input 5 subject marks and find there total,percentage and grade ?
            per>=80 A 
            per>=60 B 
            per>=45 C
